# Multitrack-Rehearsal-Tool
Multitrack rehearsal tool built for churches by [Ada Bible Church](http://adabible.org/) on the [Keystone.js](keystonejs.com) CMS Platform. [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) is a powerful Node.js content management system and web app framework built on [express](http://expressjs.com) and [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com). Keystone makes it easy to create sophisticated web sites and apps, and comes with a beautiful auto-generated Admin UI.

This app provides a method for churches to publish their tracks online to give their musicians an easy way to log on and rehearse. Only desktop browsers are supported, as mobile browsers cannot reliably process the song data. Users can control volume, mute, or solo individual tracks, as well as play, pause, stop, and scrub through the songs by clicking in the timeline.
